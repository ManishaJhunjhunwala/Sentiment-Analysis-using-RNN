# Sentiment-Analysis-using-RNN
 In this project I have constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I have created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I have also deployed my model and constructed a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
